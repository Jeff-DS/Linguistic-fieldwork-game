# Linguistic-fieldwork-game
A simple text-based game (very abstractly) simulating linguistic fieldwork, written while I was doing [exercise 45 of Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex45.html).

The idea is that the player is a field linguist working with a speaker of an unknown language, analyzing the data in order to figure out the phonetics, phonology, morphology and syntax of the language. Not all of the problems are filled in; I started with dummy problems and then started writing real ones to see what issues would come up (e.g., Unicode encoding so the [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) characters work), but quickly discovered that writing 36 multiple-choice linguistics problems spanning four subfields and three languages I haven't studied would be too time-consuming for what is, after all, a coding exercise, not a linguistics exercise.

At the end of the main file, I've left a bunch of the notes I wrote to myself while planning, writing, and trouble-shooting the game, as a record of some of my thought processes. (Note that these mostly reflect my coding knowledge as of a couple months ago, not now.)
